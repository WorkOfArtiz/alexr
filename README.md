# Alexr, a tiny lexer

Welcome to alexr (arthur's lexer), a tiny lexer that can be statically dumped into your
program.

## Usage

When `make build` is ran, both dynamic and static library files are generated
using your local compiler.

From there on you can use it as any other library, with `alexr.h` as the header to include.

Also note that you can just embed the source directly.
